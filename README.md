## Features
- Platform-independent, no native dependencies â€” it even works in VS Code for Web
- File extension association: Just click on a `.sqlite` or `.db` file and the custom viewer opens
- Fast UI with virtualized scrolling, sorting, filtering, etc.
- Seamlessly integrates with VS Code and matches your color theme

## Caveats
- __Cached__ and __Readonly__!
- Files must be __less than 2GB__ and are loaded into __system memory__
- __No query runner__

## Includes Paid Upgrade
This extension includes an optional paid upgrade that lifts some of the restrictions above.
