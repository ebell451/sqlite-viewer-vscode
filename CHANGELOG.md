# CHANGELOG

## v0.5 (Prerelease)
### WAL Mode Support
This version introduces support for __reading WAL mode databases__. It works across all VSCode file systems including local, remote, and even on web such as on github.dev (for the rare occasion that a `-wal` file is checked into git).

This fixes a common issue where the contents of a `-wal` file that hadn't reached the size limit to be committed to the main file were not showing in the UI.

Note that this features is experimental and might fail if the WAL file is heavily written to. 

Making this work required significant restructuring of the code, please report any issue you might encounter. 


## v0.4
### Solid Rewrite
SQLite Viewer 0.4 is a complete rewrite of this extension with a focus on improved performance.

It also implements SQLite Viewer's **most requested feature**: Default file association for `.db` files! 

Additionally, version 0.4 ships many quality of life improvements:

- Double clicking a cell will now open the modal and pre-select the text content
- The extension will now attempt to auto-size text columns based on visible content on first open
- Blob columns containing known image formats are previewed inline
- Blob columns up to 256 bytes (that aren't images) are rendered in hex format instead of as a download button
- Pinning a row will no longer remove it from the main view
- Columns can now be hidden in the sidebar
- The `ROWID` column can now be displayed (enable in sidebar)
- It is now possible to select and rearrange multiple columns at the same time in the sidebar
- The modal/dialog view can now be resized
- Downloading a blob will now automatically add an appropriate file extension if it can be inferred
- Column sizes and pinned now persist when switching to another table (but not after closing the tab/file) 

### Performance
- Faster virtualized scrolling
- Faster columns resizing

### Style
- Many aspects of the extension's UI should match VSCode's style closer
