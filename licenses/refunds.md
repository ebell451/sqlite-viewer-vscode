# Refund Policy for SQLite Viewer PRO

_Last updated: 10 Dec 2024_

SQLite Viewer PRO offers a 14-day refund policy. If you are not satisfied with your purchase for any reason, you can request a full refund within 14 days of the purchase dateâ€”no questions asked.

After the 14-day period, refunds will generally not be issued. However, exceptions may apply in certain cases, such as:

- Duplicate Charges: If you were accidentally charged more than once for the same purchase, we will issue a refund for the duplicate transaction(s).
- License Key Issues: If you are unable to retrieve or activate your license key due to a technical error that we cannot resolve, a refund may be granted.
-	Other Exceptional Circumstances: Refunds may be considered in rare, extraordinary cases at the sole discretion of the SQLite Viewer PRO team.

__Exception for Business Edition__: The Business Edition enables permanent offline usage through Offline Activation. Because this activation is irreversible, refunds cannot be granted once a device has been activated for permanent offline use.

For any refund-related inquiries or assistance, please contact refunds@sqliteviewer.app.
